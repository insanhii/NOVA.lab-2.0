    manual: {
      aim: "To design, simulate, and analyze the performance of an Agent Architecture (Simple Reflex Agent) within a dynamic, deterministic, fully observable two-location vacuum environment under SPPU 2024 Pattern.",
      objectives: [
        "Deconstruct the PAGE (Percepts, Actions, Goals, Environment) formal specification of autonomous agents.",
        "Implement Condition-Action (If-Then) production rules using state perception tuple <Location, Status>.",

        "Measure performance metrics: Cleanliness ratio vs energy expenditure (number of actions)."
      ],
      theory: `### 1. Intuition & Real-World Analogy
Think of an autonomous cleaning robot (like an iRobot Roomba). How does it decide what to do at any given instant? In its simplest manifestation—a **Simple Reflex Agent**—it has zero memory of the past. It operates entirely on current sensory perception: *"If current tile is dirty, turn on vacuum motor. If clean, advance to the next zone."*

### 2. Formal PEAS Specification (SPPU 2024 Standard)
* **Performance Measure:** +10 points for each clean room per time step; -1 point per movement penalty (energy conservation); -10 penalty for attempting illegal moves.
* **Environment:** Fully observable, deterministic, static 2-room grid [Room A, Room B].
* **Actuators:** Stepper motors [Left, Right], Suction turbine [Suck], Idle state [NoOp].
* **Sensors:** Infrared dirt sensor [Dirty, Clean], Bump/location encoder [Location A, Location B].

### 3. State Space Representation
* **State Vector:** S = (Location, Status_A, Status_B) where Location ∈ {A, B}, Status ∈ {Clean, Dirty}.
* **Total Distinct World States:** 2 locations × 2^2 dirt configurations = 8 distinct global world states.
* **Condition-Action Rules:**
  1. IF State == [*, Dirty] THEN Action = 'Suck'
  2. IF State == [A, Clean] THEN Action = 'Right'
  3. IF State == [B, Clean] THEN Action = 'Left'
  4. IF State == [Clean, Clean] and verified THEN Action = 'NoOp' (Halt)

### 4. Critical Engineering Pitfall: The Infinite Loop Trap
A pure reflex agent with no internal memory in a partially observable environment can oscillate endlessly between Room A and Room B if dirt reappears or if sensor noise occurs. Adding an internal state counter or environment tracking turns this into a rational **Model-Based Agent**.`,

      ],
      theory: `### 1. Intuition & The Big Picture
The Tower of Hanoi is not merely a mathematical puzzle; it is the definitive benchmark for understanding **Divide & Conquer recursion** and **State-Space Tree Traversal**. The challenge lies in moving $n$ stacked disks from a source rod (A) to a destination rod (C) using an auxiliary rod (B), without ever placing a larger disk onto a smaller one.

### 2. State-Space Formulation
* **State Representation:** A tuple of length $n$, where the $i$-th element represents the peg currently holding disk $i$: $S = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n)$ with $p_k \in \{A, B, C\}$.
* **Start State:** All disks on source peg: $(A, A, ..., A)$.
* **Goal State:** All disks transferred to destination peg: $(C, C, ..., C)$.
* **Total States:** For $n$ disks, exactly $3^n$ distinct legal states exist. The state space graph of Tower of Hanoi forms the self-similar fractal known as the **Sierpiński Triangle**.

### 3. Recurrence & Mathematical Proof of Optimality
To transfer $n$ disks from Source to Destination:
1. Move top $n-1$ disks from Source to Aux $\rightarrow T(n-1)$ moves.
2. Move largest $n$-th disk from Source to Dest $\rightarrow 1$ move.
3. Move $n-1$ disks from Aux to Dest $\rightarrow T(n-1)$ moves.

$$T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1$$
Solving by expansion:
$$T(n) = 2(2T(n-2) + 1) + 1 = 2^2 T(n-2) + 2 + 1 = ... = 2^n - 1$$
For 3 disks: $2^3 - 1 = 7$ moves. For 4 disks: $2^4 - 1 = 15$ moves.

### 4. Constraints & Invariants
* **Rule 1 (Unitary Motion):** Only one disk may be manipulated per step.
* **Rule 2 (Strict Top Access):** Only the uppermost disk on any rod may be picked.
* **Rule 3 (Size Monotonicity Invariant):** For any rod $R$, if disks $d_i$ and $d_j$ are on $R$ with $d_i$ above $d_j$, then $\text{Size}(d_i) < \text{Size}(d_j)$.`,

Imagine dropping a pebble into a calm pond. The ripples expand outward uniformly in concentric circles. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** behaves identically: it explores all immediate neighbor nodes at distance 1 before inspecting any node at distance 2, and so forth. 

### 2. Why BFS Guarantees the Shortest Path
In an unweighted graph (or a grid where every step cost $c = 1$), the first time BFS discovers the goal node $G$, it is **guaranteed** to be via the shortest sequence of edges. Why? Because any path discovered later will have depth $\ge d$.

### 3. Key Data Structures
* **Frontier (FIFO Queue):** Houses nodes discovered but not yet expanded.
* **Explored Set (Visited HashSet):** Remembers visited coordinate keys (e.g., \`"r-c"\`). Without this, the agent cycles infinitely between adjacent nodes.
* **Parent Pointer Map:** Maps each child node to its predecessor to reconstruct the optimal trajectory backwards once the goal is hit.

### 4. Complexity & Memory Bottleneck
* **Branching Factor ($b$):** Maximum outgoing edges from a cell (up to 4 in a grid: Up, Down, Left, Right).
* **Depth ($d$):** Steps required to reach goal.
* **Nodes Generated:** $1 + b + b^2 + b^3 + ... + b^d = O(b^d)$.
* **Memory Reality Check:** Because BFS stores *all* frontier nodes at depth $d$, memory exhaustion ($O(b^d)$ space) almost always occurs before CPU timeout on deep graphs.`,

        "Implement parity checking via inversion count to detect mathematically unsolvable starting configurations."
      ],
      theory: `### 1. Intuition: Why Uninformed Search Fails
If you attempt to solve an 8-puzzle with BFS or DFS, the state space explodes rapidly ($9! / 2 = 181,440$ reachable states). BFS expands nodes blindly in all directions. **A* Search introduces 'intelligence'** by directing the search towards the goal using an educated guess called a **Heuristic ($h(n)$)**.

### 2. The Total Evaluation Function
$$f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$$
* **$g(n)$ [Past Cost]:** Exact number of steps/moves taken from initial board to current state.
* **$h(n)$ [Future Estimate]:** Estimated cost from current board to the goal.
* **$f(n)$ [Total Score]:** Estimated total solution cost passing through node $n$. The Priority Queue always expands the state with the lowest $f(n)$.

### 3. Admissibility & Dominance
* **Admissibility:** A heuristic is admissible if it *never overestimates* the true cost to reach the goal ($h(n) \le h^*(n)$). This guarantees that A* finds the mathematically optimal solution.
* **Heuristic 1: Misplaced Tiles ($h_1$):** Number of tiles not in their goal position. Admissible because each misplaced tile must move at least once.
* **Heuristic 2: Manhattan Distance ($h_2$):** Sum of absolute horizontal and vertical distances of tiles from their target slots:
  $$h_2 = \sum_{i=1}^8 (|r_i - r_{\\text{goal}}| + |c_i - c_{\\text{goal}}|)$$
* **Dominance Theorem:** Since $h_2(n) \ge h_1(n)$ for all states $n$, Manhattan Distance dominates Misplaced Tiles. It provides a tighter lower bound, pruning exponentially more redundant search trees.

### 4. Mathematical Solvability (Inversion Parity)
An 8-puzzle state is solvable if and only if its **inversion count** is even. An inversion occurs when a tile with a higher number precedes a tile with a lower number in linear array order (ignoring the blank tile). If inversions are odd, no sequence of moves can ever reach $[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0]$.`,

      theory: `## Adversarial Search

Adversarial search is used in Artificial Intelligence when two or more agents **compete** against each other with opposing objectives. In such environments, each player tries to maximize their own advantage while minimizing the opponent's.

**Classic examples:** Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Connect Four, Go.

Unlike ordinary search problems where we only consider a single agent trying to reach a goal, adversarial search involves **two alternating players**:
- **MAX player** — tries to maximize the score (e.g., you)
- **MIN player** — tries to minimize the score (e.g., the opponent)

---

## Minimax Algorithm

The **Minimax algorithm** is the backbone of adversarial game search. It performs a depth-first search through the entire game tree:

- At **MAX nodes**: choose the child with the **maximum** utility value
- At **MIN nodes**: choose the child with the **minimum** utility value
- At **leaf nodes** (terminal states): return the heuristic or actual utility value

### Complexity Without Pruning:
- **Time:** O(b^d) where b = branching factor, d = depth
- **Space:** O(b × d)

## Alpha-Beta Pruning

**Alpha-Beta pruning** is an optimization of Minimax that **skips branches** that cannot possibly affect the final decision. It maintains two values:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **α (Alpha)** | Best value MAX player can guarantee so far (initialized to -∞) |
| **β (Beta)** | Best value MIN player can guarantee so far (initialized to +∞) |

### Pruning Rule:
> **If α ≥ β at any node, stop exploring further children of that node (prune!).**

- At a **MAX node**: update α = max(α, current_value). If α ≥ β → prune remaining children (**beta-cut**)
- At a **MIN node**: update β = min(β, current_value). If β ≤ α → prune remaining children (**alpha-cut**)

### Alpha-Beta Pseudocode:
\`\`\`
alphabeta(node, depth, α, β, isMaximizing):
  if depth == 0 or terminal(node):
      return evaluate(node)
  
  if isMaximizing:
      for each child of node:
          val = alphabeta(child, depth-1, α, β, False)
          α = max(α, val)
          if α >= β:
              break  # ← Beta cut-off (prune!)
      return α
  else:
      for each child of node:
          val = alphabeta(child, depth-1, α, β, True)
          β = min(β, val)
          if β <= α:
              break  # ← Alpha cut-off (prune!)
      return β
\`\`\`

### Complexity With Pruning:
- **Best case (perfect ordering):** O(b^(d/2)) — effectively doubles the searchable depth
- **Worst case (bad ordering):** O(b^d) — no improvement
- **Average case:** O(b^(3d/4))

> **Key Insight:** With optimal move ordering, Alpha-Beta pruning can search **twice as deep** as plain Minimax in the same time! This is why chess engines use it.

---

## Why Alpha-Beta is Better

| Aspect | Minimax | Alpha-Beta |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Nodes evaluated | All b^d nodes | ~b^(d/2) with good ordering |
| Optimal result | Yes | Yes (same answer!) |
| Memory | O(b × d) | O(b × d) |
| Real-world use | Rarely used alone | Standard in all game AI |

Alpha-Beta pruning **always returns the same result** as Minimax — it just skips branches that provably won't affect the outcome.`,

      theory: `## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**BFS** is a systematic graph/tree traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the **current depth level** before moving to the next. It uses a **FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue** as its core data structure.

### Key Properties of BFS:
| Property | BFS |
|----------|-----|
| **Complete?** | Yes (finds solution if one exists) |
| **Optimal?** | Yes (for uniform-cost edges — finds shortest path) |
| **Time Complexity** | O(b^d) where b = branching factor, d = depth |
| **Space Complexity** | O(b^d) — stores entire frontier |

---

## Grid World Formulation

The robot navigates a **5×5 grid** where:
- \`0\` = Free cell (traversable)
- \`1\` = Obstacle (blocked)
- **Start state:** (row=0, col=0) — top-left corner
- **Goal state:** (row=4, col=4) — bottom-right corner

### Actions (4 directions):
\`\`\`
UP    → (row-1, col)
DOWN  → (row+1, col)
LEFT  → (row, col-1)
RIGHT → (row, col+1)
\`\`\`

### State Space:
- **State:** (row, col) position tuple
- **Initial state:** (0, 0)
- **Goal test:** state == (4, 4)
- **Path cost:** Each step costs 1 (uniform)

---

## BFS Algorithm for Grid Navigation

\`\`\`
BFS(grid, start, goal):
  queue = FIFO_Queue()
  queue.enqueue(start)
  visited = {start}
  parent = {start: None}
  
  while queue is not empty:
      current = queue.dequeue()
      
      if current == goal:
          return reconstruct_path(parent, goal)
      
      for each neighbor in get_neighbors(current, grid):
          if neighbor not in visited:
              visited.add(neighbor)
              parent[neighbor] = current
              queue.enqueue(neighbor)
  
  return None  # No path found
\`\`\`

### Path Reconstruction:
After BFS finds the goal, we **backtrack** using the \`parent\` dictionary from goal → start to reconstruct the shortest path.

---

## Why BFS Guarantees Shortest Path

BFS expands nodes **level by level**. The first time it reaches the goal node, it has taken the minimum number of steps — because all shorter paths were explored first (FIFO ordering guarantees this).

> **BFS is like a wave expanding outward.** All cells reachable in 1 step are visited before cells reachable in 2 steps, and so on.

---

## Comparison: BFS vs DFS for Path Planning

| Criterion | BFS | DFS |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Shortest path? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Memory usage | High (stores whole frontier) | Low (single path) |
| Complete? | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (finite graphs) |
| Use case | Shortest path, maps | Maze solving, puzzles |`,

      ],
      theory: `## Water Jug Problem

The Water Jug Problem is a classic AI state space search puzzle:
- **Jug X:** Capacity = 4 litres
- **Jug Y:** Capacity = 3 litres
- **Goal:** Get exactly **2 litres** in Jug X (the 4L jug)
- **Constraint:** No measuring markings — you can only fill completely, empty completely, or pour one into the other.

---

## State Space Formulation

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|-----------|
| **State** | (x, y) — current litres in Jug X and Jug Y |
| **Initial State** | (0, 0) — both jugs empty |
| **Goal State** | (2, y) for any y — exactly 2L in 4L jug |
| **State Space** | All (x, y) where 0 ≤ x ≤ 4, 0 ≤ y ≤ 3 → **20 distinct states** |

---

## The 6 Operators

| Operator | Action | New State |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Fill X** | Fill 4L jug completely | (4, y) |
| **Fill Y** | Fill 3L jug completely | (x, 3) |
| **Empty X** | Drain 4L jug | (0, y) |
| **Empty Y** | Drain 3L jug | (x, 0) |
| **Pour X→Y** | Pour from X into Y until Y full or X empty | (x - d, y + d) |
| **Pour Y→X** | Pour from Y into X until X full or Y empty | (x + d, y - d) |

where d = min(x, 3-y) for Pour X→Y and d = min(y, 4-x) for Pour Y→X.

---

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

**DFS** explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a **LIFO Stack** (Last-In First-Out).

### DFS vs BFS for Water Jug:
| Property | DFS | BFS |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Data structure | Stack | Queue |
| Path found | Not necessarily shortest | Always shortest |
| Memory use | O(depth) — very low | O(branching^depth) — high |
| Use case | Finding ANY solution quickly | Finding shortest solution |

### DFS Algorithm:
\`\`\`
DFS(start, goal):
  stack = [(start, path=[start])]
  visited = {}
  
  while stack not empty:
      (state, path) = stack.pop()  # LIFO
      
      if state in visited: continue
      visited.add(state)
      
      if is_goal(state):
          return path
      
      for each successor in apply_operators(state):
          if successor not in visited:
              stack.push((successor, path + [successor]))
  
  return None
\`\`\`

## Solution Trace

One valid DFS solution path:
\`\`\`
(0,0) → Fill X    → (4,0)
(4,0) → Pour X→Y  → (1,3)
(1,3) → Empty Y   → (1,0)
(1,0) → Pour X→Y  → (0,1)  [wait...]
\`\`\`

Another path (BFS optimal):
\`\`\`
(0,0) → Fill Y    → (0,3)
(0,3) → Pour Y→X  → (3,0)
(3,0) → Fill Y    → (3,3)
(3,3) → Pour Y→X  → (4,2)
(4,2) → Empty X   → (0,2)
(0,2) → Pour Y→X  → (2,0) ✅ GOAL!

      theory: `## Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)

A **CSP** is defined by three components:
- **Variables X:** X = {Q1, Q2, Q3, ..., Q8} — one queen per column
- **Domains D:** D(Qi) = {1, 2, 3, ..., 8} — row position for each queen
- **Constraints C:** No two queens attack each other

### Constraints in 8-Queens:
1. **Row Constraint:** No two queens in the same row → Q_i ≠ Q_j for all i ≠ j
2. **Column Constraint:** Already handled — one queen per column by design
3. **Diagonal Constraint:** |Q_i - Q_j| ≠ |i - j| — queens not on same diagonal

---

## Backtracking Algorithm

**Backtracking** is a systematic recursive algorithm that:
1. Places one queen per column, left to right
2. For each column, tries all rows (1 to 8)
3. If a placement is **safe** → recurse to next column
4. If no safe row exists → **backtrack** to previous column and try next row

\`\`\`
Backtrack(column):
  if column > 8:
      solution found! record it.
      return
  
  for row in 1..8:
      if is_safe(row, column, current_placement):
          place queen at (row, column)
          Backtrack(column + 1)
          remove queen from (row, column)  ← BACKTRACK
\`\`\`

### is_safe() Check:
\`\`\`python
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    # Check same row in previous columns
    for c in range(col):
        if board[c] == row:
            return False

## Why Backtracking is Efficient

Brute force would try **8^8 = 16,777,216** combinations. Backtracking **prunes** invalid placements early:
- As soon as a queen placement violates a constraint, we abandon that branch immediately
- This dramatically reduces the search space to just **92 solutions** found

### Solution Count:
- **Total distinct solutions:** 92
- **Fundamental (unique up to symmetry):** 12
- **Nodes explored by backtracking:** ~15,700 (vs 16.7M brute force!)

## The 8 Attack Patterns for a Queen

A queen at position (r, c) attacks:
- **Same row:** all (r, x) for x ≠ c
- **Same column:** all (y, c) for y ≠ r  
- **Main diagonal:** (r±k, c±k) for any k
- **Anti-diagonal:** (r±k, c∓k) for any k

      theory: `## What is a Chatbot?

A **chatbot** is a computer program that simulates human conversation. There are two broad types:

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Rule-Based** | Uses predefined IF-THEN rules and pattern matching | ELIZA, ALICE, our chatbot |
| **AI/ML Based** | Uses neural networks, deep learning, LLMs | ChatGPT, Siri, Alexa |

---

## Rule-Based Pattern Matching

A rule-based chatbot works on a simple principle:

> **IF** the user's input matches a certain pattern → **THEN** respond with a specific answer

### How Pattern Matching Works:
1. **Preprocessing:** Normalize input — convert to lowercase, remove punctuation, strip whitespace
2. **Pattern Matching:** Check user input against each rule's keywords/pattern
3. **Response Generation:** Return the corresponding response for the first matching rule
4. **Default Fallback:** If no pattern matches, return a generic fallback response

---

## Production Rule System

A **production rule** has the format:

\`\`\`
Rule {
  pattern : ["keyword1", "keyword2"]   ← IF any keyword found in input
  responses: ["reply 1", "reply 2"]    ← THEN pick random response
}
\`\`\`

### Example Rules:
\`\`\`python
rules = [
    {
        "patterns": ["hello", "hi", "hey"],
        "responses": ["Hello! How can I help you?", "Hi there!"]
    },
    {
        "patterns": ["what is ai", "define ai", "artificial intelligence"],
        "responses": ["AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines."]
    },
    {
        "patterns": ["bye", "goodbye", "exit"],
        "responses": ["Goodbye! Have a great day!", "See you soon!"]
    }
]
\`\`\`

---

## ELIZA — The First Chatbot (1966)

**ELIZA** was created at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. It simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist using simple pattern matching. People found conversations with ELIZA surprisingly convincing — this effect is now called the **ELIZA Effect**.

Key idea: ELIZA reflected user statements back as questions:
- User: "I am sad"
- ELIZA: "Why do you say you are sad?"

---

## Limitations of Rule-Based Chatbots

| Limitation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **No context memory** | Each response is independent, no conversation history |
| **Pattern brittleness** | Slight rephrasing breaks matching (typos, synonyms) |
| **Limited coverage** | Only answers questions explicitly programmed |
| **No learning** | Rules are static, doesn't improve from interactions |
| **No semantics** | Works on keywords, not actual meaning |

---

## Modern NLP Evolution

\`\`\`
Rule-Based → Statistical NLP → Word Embeddings → Transformers → LLMs
  (1960s)      (1990s-2000s)    (Word2Vec 2013)   (BERT 2018)   (GPT-4 2023)
\`\`\`

While rule-based chatbots are limited, they remain valuable for:
- Structured domains (flight booking, FAQ bots)
- Explainable AI (you can audit every decision)
- Low-resource environments (no GPU required)`,

        options: ["Generate a response from neural network", "Preprocess (normalize) the user input — lowercase, remove punctuation", "Look up a database", "Call an external API"],
        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation: "Preprocessing normalizes user input by converting to lowercase and removing punctuation. This ensures 'Hello!' and 'hello' both match the same patterns, making the system more robust."
      },
      {
        question: "ELIZA, the first chatbot (1966), used which technique?",
        options: ["Deep Learning", "Reinforcement Learning", "Pattern Matching with rule-based responses", "Statistical Language Models"],
        correctIndex: 2,
        explanation: "ELIZA (1966, MIT) used simple pattern matching. It reflected user statements as questions, simulating a Rogerian therapist. This pioneering work demonstrated that pattern matching could create surprisingly convincing conversations."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the major limitation of rule-based chatbots compared to LLMs?",
        options: ["They are too slow to respond", "They cannot handle questions not covered by predefined rules (brittle, no context)", "They require too much memory", "They cannot display text on screen"],
        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation: "Rule-based chatbots can only respond to patterns explicitly programmed into them. Any rephrasing or out-of-scope question gets a fallback. They also have no memory of context — each response is stateless."
      },
      {
        question: "In a production rule system for chatbots, what does the 'THEN' part represent?",
        options: ["The user's input", "The pattern to match against", "The response to return when the pattern matches", "The preprocessing step"],
        correctIndex: 2,
        explanation: "A production rule is IF (pattern matches) THEN (return response). The 'THEN' part is the chatbot's response — it could be a fixed string or selected randomly from a set of possible responses."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the 'ELIZA Effect'?",
        options: ["The speed improvement of pattern matching algorithms", "The tendency of humans to anthropomorphize and attribute understanding to simple rule-based programs", "A type of neural network architecture", "The 1966 programming language used to write ELIZA"],
        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation: "The 'ELIZA Effect' describes how people naturally attribute understanding, empathy, or intelligence to computer programs that simply reflect or rephrase their words — even when no real understanding exists."
